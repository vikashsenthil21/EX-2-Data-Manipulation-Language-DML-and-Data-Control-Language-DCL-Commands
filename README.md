The SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

INSERT: It is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE: It is used to delete records from a database table.

```
create table manager(enumber number(6),ename char(15),
salary number(5),commission number(4),
annualsalary number(7),Hiredate date,designation char(10),
deptno number(2),reporting char(10));
```
## insert the following values into the table
```
insert into manager values(7369,'Dharsan',2500,500,30000,
'30-June-81','clerk',10,'John');
insert into manager values(7839,'Subu',3000,400,36000,
